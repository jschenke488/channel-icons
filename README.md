> ## TL;DR: This project is dead (unless someone revives it)
> I'm no longer active in the Discord client-mod community and I don't have plans to keep working on this. There isn't any drama for you to catch up on, I just got bored and now I'm doing other things.
> **If anyone wants to officially maintain this project**, talk to me on Discord, my tag is Valentine#7078.
